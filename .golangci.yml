  # Defines a set of rules to ignore issues.
  # It does not skip the analysis, and so does not ignore "typecheck" errors.
  exclusions:
    # Mode of the generated files analysis.
    #
    # - `strict`: sources are excluded by strictly following the Go generated file convention.
    #    Source files that have lines matching only the following regular expression will be excluded: `^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$`
    #    This line must appear before the first non-comment, non-blank text in the file.
    #    https://go.dev/s/generatedcode
    # - `lax`: sources are excluded if they contain lines like `autogenerated file`, `code generated`, `do not edit`, etc.
    # - `disable`: disable the generated files exclusion.

    # Default: lax
